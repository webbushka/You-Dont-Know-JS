<h2>Publishing</h2>
<p>These books are being released here as drafts, free to read, but are also being edited, produced, and published through O'Reilly.</p>
<p>If you like the content you find here, and want to support more content like it, please purchase the books once they are available for sale, through your normal book sources. :)</p>
<p>If you'd like to contribute financially towards the effort (or any of my other OSS work) aside from purchasing the books, I do have a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/getify">patreon</a> that I would always appreciate your generosity towards.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/getify"><img src="http://blog.getify.com/wp-content/uploads/patreon.png"></a></p>
<h2>In-person Training</h2>
<p>The content for these books derives heavily from a series of training materials I teach professionally (in both public and private-corporate workshop format), called &quot;Advanced JS: The 'What You Need To Know' Parts&quot;.</p>
<p>If you like this content and would like to contact me regarding conducting training on these, or other various JS/HTML5/node.js topics, please reach out to me through any of these channels listed here:</p>
<p><a href="http://getify.me">http://getify.me</a></p>
<h2>Online Video Training</h2>
<p>I also have some JS training material available in on-demand video format. I teach courses through <a href="https://FrontendMasters.com">Frontend Masters</a>, like my <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/advanced-javascript/">Advanced JS</a> workshop (more courses coming soon!).</p>
<p>That same course is also <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/advanced-javascript">available through Pluralsight</a>.</p>
<h2>Content Contributions</h2>
<p>Any contributions you make to this effort <strong>are of course greatly appreciated</strong>.</p>
<p>However, if you choose to contribute content (not just typo corrections) to this repo, you agree that you're giving me a non-exclusive license to use that content for the book series, as I (and O'Reilly) deem appropriate. You probably guessed that already, but we just have to make the lawyers happy by explicitly stating it.</p>
<p>So: blah, blah, blah... :)</p>
